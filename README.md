A rather short but comprehensive guide about installing "MCSniperGO" (Credit: Kqzz) on Windows...
...with minimal technological expertise.
```

-------------------------------------------

# **I. Introduction**

MCSniperGO is a sniper designed in GOLANG. It works splendidly and can be downloaded for free [here](https://github.com/Kqzz/MCsniperGO). This sniper was developed by Kqzz so all credit goes to him and other contributors listed on the repository. Although the sniper does indeed have a guide in its README.md, I wanted to make a shorter and more concise one for newer snipers. This guide was made strictly for Windows users. Warning however, Mojang has publicly announced that they [condemn sniping using bots or other automated tools](https://twitter.com/Mojang_Ined/status/1448652087043133440) so proceed with caution. Mojang doesn't strictly enforce this decision but it's still good to be cautious nonetheless.


# **II. Downloading the Sniper**

> While it might seem normal to download the `Code` via the `Download ZIP` button, this is not the case.

You will instead want to navigate to the `Releases` page as found below:
