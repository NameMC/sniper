A rather short but comprehensive guide about installing "MCSniperGO" (Credit: Kqzz) on Windows...
...with minimal technological expertise.
```

-------------------------------------------

# **I. Introduction**

MCSniperGO is a sniper designed in GOLANG. It works splendidly and can be downloaded for free [here](https://github.com/Kqzz/MCsniperGO). This sniper was developed by Kqzz so all credit goes to him and other contributors listed on the repository. Although the sniper does indeed have a guide in its README.md, I wanted to make a shorter and more concise one for newer snipers. This guide was made strictly for Windows users. Warning however, Mojang has publicly announced that they [condemn sniping using bots or other automated tools](https://twitter.com/Mojang_Ined/status/1448652087043133440) so proceed with caution. Mojang doesn't strictly enforce this decision but it's still good to be cautious nonetheless.


# **II. Downloading the Sniper**

Before downloading the sniper, install Python on your device if you haven't already. You may choose to skip this step and revisit it later if you are having issues. Python can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/), any version above 3.7 should work.

> While it might seem normal to download the sniper via the `Download ZIP` button, this is not the case.

Scroll down to the `README.md` section of the repository to locate the `Releases` hyperlink.

This guide was strictly made for Windows devices. Select one of the Windows downloads to continue with the installation:

You should now have an `.exe` file. Do not interact with it yet; first, you'll want to make a folder for it. Right-click on your desktop and create a new folder. Name it whatever you wish. Place the `.exe` file in the folder and then open it. It should look like this (or similar):
