A rather short but comprehensive guide about installing "MCSniperGO" (Credit: Kqzz) on Windows...
...with minimal technological expertise.

# **I. Introduction**

MCSniperGO is a sniper designed in GOLANG. It works splendidly and can be downloaded for free [here](https://github.com/Kqzz/MCsniperGO). This sniper was developed by Kqzz so all credit goes to him and other contributors listed on the repository. Although the sniper does indeed have a guide in its README.md, I wanted to make a shorter and more concise one for newer snipers. This guide was made strictly for Windows users.
